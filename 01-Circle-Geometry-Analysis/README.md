# Circle Geometry Analysis

## 📝 Problem Description
This program analyzes the spatial relationship between two circles in a 2D plane.
Based on the center coordinates (x, y) and radius (r) of two circles, the program determines their relative position and calculates the area of their overlap.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Geometric Logic:** Detects 6 specific states: Identical, contained, internal touch, intersection, external touch, and disjoint.
- **Precision Handling:** Implements `EPSILON` and relative scaling to handle floating-point comparison errors accurately.
- **Mathematical Computation:** Calculates the area of intersection using the circular segment formula.
- **Robust Input Validation:** Detects non-numeric inputs and logical errors (negative/zero radii).

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Coordinate Geometry
- Floating-point Arithmetic
- Trigonometric Functions (`acos`, `sqrt`)
- Conditional Logic & Input Validation
